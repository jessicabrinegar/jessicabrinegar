- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jessicabrinegar
- ðŸŒ± I miraculously found my love of programming, data analysis, and data visualization while in a Cognitive Science master's program, leading me to terminate my academic career to become a developer. I have completed a full-stack bootcamp and am continuing my education through self-learning and various online courses. With my analytical mind, attention to detail, and unwavering curiosity, I envision myself one day working in data science, cybersecurity, or AI engineering. When I'm not coding, I'm travelling to new places, playing piano or tennis, skiing, or taking a bike ride!
