- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jessicabrinegar
- ðŸŒ± I miraculously found programming while in a Cognitive Science master's program, leading me to drop out to pursue a career in Software Engineering. I have big dreams of one day being a Data Scientist and/or AI Engineer, but I'm equally excited for the journey to get there. When I'm not coding, I'm travelling to new places, playing piano or tennis, or taking a bike ride!
